Data Visualization Class at UIUC final project. This is a simple web that shows some information about how COVID 19 affected the US economy. I used it as a reference to the S&P 500 index, and I got the data from the Yahoo website. 

Also, the Tableau visualization for COVID-19 in the U.S: https://public.tableau.com/profile/omar.boffil#!/vizhome/Covid-19DashboardU_S/Covid-19inU_S
